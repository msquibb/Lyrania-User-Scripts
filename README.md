# Ackron's Lyrania User Scripts
 Just some various user scripts that I use while playing Lyrania to improve the play experience. 

 No, there are no hacks or cheats in here, go take that trash somewhere else.

## Party Bag Flavor

This script reads through all of the rewards that you get from opening multiple pink party bags, and keeps a running count of the important items (autos, tokens, dungeon points, orbs and jewelry boxes), highlights some of them in the list, and then adds a summary at the top.

 To see an example of how this functions, look at [this JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/Ackron/trhusLng/31/).
